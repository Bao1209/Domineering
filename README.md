# Domineering
The objective of this assignment is to practice (1) defining functions (being a callee), (2) calling 
functions (being a caller), and (3) representing special kind of data.
You will implement a two-player paper-and-pencil game called Domineering. Two players take turns 
to put their dominoes to a 4 Ã— 4 grid. Each domino occupies two consecutive spaces in the grid. 
Player 1 must place his/her dominoes vertically, while Player 2 must place his/her dominoes
horizontally. The player who can no longer put a domino in his/her turn is the loser, and the other 
player is the winner. This game can never result in a draw: even when the grid is full, the last player 
who puts a domino is considered the winner (because the next player has no places to put). Figure 1
shows an example series of game play. The dominoes put by Players 1 and 2 are marked as A and B
respectively.
